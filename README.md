# Patient Specific Spinal Surgery Complication Predictor using a Repeated Random Balanced Sub-Sampling Random Forest Procedure
This app lets doctors input patient information such as past medical history, current diagnoses, age, sex, race, and hospital information to predict the likelihood of the patient having a complication after a spinal surgery. 

## Technologies Implemented Include:
* Node and Express
* Python
  * pandas for data cleaning and processing
  * scikit-learn for Random Forest algorithm
  * Created Repeated Random Balanced Sub Sampling algorithm to account for low positive complication counts to increase accuracy.
* Bootstrap for styling and mobile friendly use
